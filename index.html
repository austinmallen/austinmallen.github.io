    <h2>Austin M. Allen</h2>
    <p>I am a writer (mostly of software 
    documentation and poetry).</p>
    <p>I tinker with music,
    and think a lot about cyberspace(s).</p>
    <p>There's other stuff I'm interested in, too â€” <br>
    over time I'll build my aesthetical waystation here...<p>
    <p>Maybe you'd like to talk or collaborate,<br>don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
